## 🛠️ Function to Check for Stow

## ➡️ Check Dependencies

## ☁️ Handle Repository (Modified)

# --- Original cloning logic removed/commented out ---
# Your script assumes the repository is already set up and cloned
# at the location defined by STOW_DIR. We'll check if the package
# directory exists before attempting to stow.
